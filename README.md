# gomycode-to-do-app


This is a simple, yet stylish, todo application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their tasks with details like month, week, day, and time, and features a retro-inspired design with a theme toggle.

Task Management: Add, mark as complete, and delete tasks.

•
Detailed Task Entries: Each task can include a month, week (1-5), day, and time range.

•
Input Validation: Ensures correct format for month, week, day, and time inputs.

•
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.
